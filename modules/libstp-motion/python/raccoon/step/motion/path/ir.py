"""Intermediate representation for the motion path pipeline.

Compiler passes operate on ``list[PathNode]``:

- ``Segment``    — one motion primitive (linear / turn / arc / follow_line / spline).
- ``SideAction`` — a non-motion step pinned to a transition point.
- ``None``       — placeholder for a deferred step resolved at runtime.

These types are intentionally pure data — they hold no robot reference and
no runtime state.  Anything stateful (current motion, world tracker) lives
in the executor / middleware layer.

                          optional ``heading_deg`` and ``condition``.
    - ``"turn"``        — ``sign``, ``angle_rad``, ``speed_scale``,

    - ``"arc"``         — ``radius_m``, ``arc_angle_rad``, ``speed_scale``,
                          ``lateral``.
    - ``"crab_arc"``    — ``radius_m``, ``arc_angle_rad``, ``speed_scale`` plus
                          ``crab_from`` / ``crab_to`` (body-frame unit velocity
                          directions at entry / exit). A constant-heading 90°
                          corner blend for a holonomic base: the body velocity
                          vector rotates from ``crab_from`` to ``crab_to`` over a
                          quarter circle WITHOUT rotating the heading. Driven by
                          a Python adapter (no warm-start unless profiled). Used
                          by ``cut_corners`` for ``forward↔strafe`` corners.
    - ``"follow_line"`` — same shape as ``"linear"`` plus ``opaque_step``
                          (the original LineFollow step). Adapter delegates
                          lifecycle to the step's ``on_start``/``on_update``.
    - ``"spline"``      — ``opaque_step`` (the SplinePath step). No warm-start.
    - ``"diagonal"``    — ``opaque_step`` (the DriveAngle step) plus the known
                          body-frame displacement ``forward_m`` / ``left_m`` and
                          ``distance_m``. Same opaque shape as a step; the travel
                          direction is decoupled from the held heading. No
