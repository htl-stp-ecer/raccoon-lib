"""Intermediate representation for the motion path pipeline.

Compiler passes operate on ``list[PathNode]``:

- ``Segment``    — one motion primitive (linear / turn / arc / follow_line / spline).
- ``SideAction`` — a non-motion step pinned to a transition point.
- ``None``       — placeholder for a deferred step resolved at runtime.

These types are intentionally pure data — they hold no robot reference and
no runtime state.  Anything stateful (current motion, world tracker) lives
in the executor / middleware layer.
